# Block_Chain_Simulator
A simulated blockchain environment built using Streamlit, designed to demonstrate how quantum computing (via Shorâ€™s Algorithm) can compromise classical cryptographic systems. The project models secure transaction creation, quantum-based forgery, and validation workflows, offering insights into post-quantum blockchain security.
